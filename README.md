pkgdown is designed to make it quick and easy to build a website for your package. You can see pkgdown in action at <https://pkgdown.r-lib.org>: this is the output of pkgdown applied to the latest version of pkgdown. Learn more in `vignette("pkgdown")` or `?build_site`.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("pkgdown")
# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("r-lib/pkgdown")
```

## Usage

Get started with [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Run once to configure your package to use pkgdown
usethis::use_pkgdown()
```

Use pkgdown to update your website:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Run to build the website
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This generates a `docs/` directory containing a website. Your `README.md` becomes the homepage, documentation in `man/` generates a function reference, and vignettes will be rendered into `articles/`. Read `vignette("pkgdown")` for more details and to learn how to customise your site.

If you are using GitHub, the easiest way to make this your package website is to check into git, then go to settings for your repo and make sure that the __GitHub pages__ source is set to "gh-pages branch /(root) folder". Be sure to update the URL on your github repository homepage so others can easily navigate to your new site.

## In the wild

At last count, pkgdown is used [by over 5,000 packages](https://github.com/search?q=pkgdown.css+in%3Apath&type=Code). 

Here are a few examples created by contributors to pkgdown:

* [bayesplot](http://mc-stan.org/bayesplot/index.html)
  ([source](https://github.com/stan-dev/bayesplot/tree/gh-pages)):
  plotting functions for posterior analysis, model checking, and MCMC 
  diagnostics.

* [valr](https://rnabioco.github.io/valr/) 
  ([source](https://github.com/rnabioco/valr)): 
  read and manipulate genome intervals and signals.

* [mkin](http://jranke.github.io/mkin/)
  ([source](https://github.com/jranke/mkin)):
  calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report

* [NMF](http://renozao.github.io/NMF/master/index.html)
  ([source](https://github.com/renozao/NMF)):
  a framework to perform non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).

Comparing the source and output of these sites is a great way to learn new pkgdown techniques.
